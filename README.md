# Singular-Value-Decomposition-Eigenfaces
We use the singular value decomposition on a matrix of pictures and explore the picture details captured by the modes produced in the matrix decomposition. We also compare the significance of each mode, and how details vary as we increase the number of modes active in image reconstruction.
